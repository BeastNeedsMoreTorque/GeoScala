# Geo Scala Document

## Introduction
Geo Scala is a geo library written by Java and Scala.
It support:
- 2d-sphere geometry
- Squared geo-hash block based geo-index
- Heatmap generator and merge
- Various basic geometry elements and types
- GPS Timeseries type and it's compression, integral and Frechet fetch algorithms
- Polygon algorithm
- Fast geo near point search
- Convert WGS84 to other encrypted coordinates and convert them back
- (DOING) Machine learning algorithms such as DBScan (To be develop)
- (TODO) Clean and filter route with noises
- (TODO) Add road-network processing support


**It's tool to process GPS data usefully and quiet easily**
